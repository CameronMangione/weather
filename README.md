# Seattle Weather Project (This is a template README.md file that you can adapt to your project)

> This project analyzes differences in precipitation data between one station Seattle and a singular station in either Washington D.C./Pittsburgh/Denver.

## Project Overview

Provide a short and concise overview of the project. We are looking to solve the problem of knowing if it rains more in Seattle over a four year time period compared to another US city. We used precipitation data from NCEI in the timeframe of 01/01/2018-12/31/2022. **To be determined** the key outcomes or findings.

- **Objective:** Compare precipitation differences between two US cities between the time frame of 01/01/2018-12/31/2022.
- **Domain:** (e.g., Healthcare, Finance, E-commerce, etc.)
- **Key Techniques:** (e.g., Regression, Classification, Clustering, NLP, Time Series)
